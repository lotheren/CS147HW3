All work being done by: Mike Bibb

Glaring issues that need to be addressed. I need to work the images into the database and keep track
of each ones raitings.

I also have to fix the index.php page so that I can add a raiting to a single image and not all of them at once.

I have not started the upload image page.

I have to sort the images by when they were added to the.

Fix  namespaces. I had them added but it broke everything so I took it off until later.

Fix the MVC of the website.

Last thing would be touch up the site so that it looks nice.
